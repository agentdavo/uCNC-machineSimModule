‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other project files)
```

> **Note:** Ensure that all subdirectories (`tinygl/`, `libstlio/`, and `stb/`) contain the necessary files as per the directory structure.

### 3. **Compile the CNC Rendering Framework**

The provided `Makefile` automates the compilation process, handling the building of TinyGL and libstlio, as well as compiling and linking the main application.

Run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
make
```

**What This Does:**

- **Compiles TinyGL:**
  - Compiles all `.c` files within `tinygl/src/` into object files (`.o`).
  - Archives these object files into the static library `libtinygl.a`.

- **Compiles libstlio:**
  - Compiles all `.c` files within `libstlio/src/` into object files (`.o`).
  - Archives these object files into the static library `libstlio.a`.

- **Compiles Main Application:**
  - Compiles `render_robot.c` into `render_robot.o`, ensuring it includes `stb_image_write.h` from the `stb/` directory.

- **Links Executable:**
  - Links `render_robot.o` with `libtinygl.a` and `libstlio.a` to produce the final executable `render_robot`.

**Optimizations Included:**

- **`-O3`:** Enables high-level optimizations for maximum performance.
- **`-std=gnu99`:** Uses the GNU99 standard for C.
- **`-fopenmp`:** Enables OpenMP for multithreading support.
- **Include Paths:** Ensures the compiler locates header files in `tinygl/include/`, `libstlio/include/`, and `stb/`.

### 4. **Optional: Use Parallel Compilation**

To speed up the build process by utilizing multiple CPU cores, you can invoke `make` with the `-j` flag followed by the number of jobs. For example, to use all available cores:

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

This command tells `make` to execute multiple compilation jobs in parallel, significantly reducing build times on multi-core systems.

## üéÆ Usage

Execute the compiled program with optional command-line arguments to customize the rendering process.

```bash
./render_robot [totalFrames] [rotationSpeed] [radius] [elevation]
```

## üîß Enhancements Using Enhanced TinyGL C-Chads Features

Leveraging the enhanced features of TinyGL can further optimize and expand the capabilities of the CNC Machine Rendering Framework:

- **SIMD Acceleration:**
  - Enable `alignas` in `zfeatures.h` to take advantage of SIMD optimizations, significantly improving vertex processing speed.

- **Multithreading with OpenMP:**
  - Utilize OpenMP to parallelize rendering tasks, such as `glDrawPixels` and `glPostProcess()`, to maximize performance on multi-core processors.

- **Advanced Buffer Management:**
  - Implement server-side buffers using `glGenBuffers`, `glBindBuffer`, and related functions to manage vertex and texture data more efficiently.

- **Post-Processing Effects:**
  - Use `glPostProcess()` to apply custom post-processing effects to rendered frames, enhancing visual quality or adding specific graphical features.

- **Extended OpenGL Functions:**
  - Incorporate additional OpenGL functions like `glDrawText`, `glSetEnableSpecular`, and `glGetTexturePixmap` to add more functionality, such as text rendering and advanced lighting controls.

- **Error Handling and Debugging:**
  - Enable comprehensive `glGetError()` functionality to aid in debugging and ensure rendering correctness.

### üìå Example: Using `glDrawText` for Annotations

Enhance your rendered images by adding text annotations directly onto the framebuffer.

```c
// Before rendering the scene
glColor3f(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f); // Set text color to white
glDrawText("Robot Arm", 10, 10, 0xFFFFFFFF);
```

### üìå Example: Implementing Custom Post-Processing

Apply a custom post-processing effect to invert the colors of the rendered frame.

```c
GLuint invertColors(GLint x, GLint y, GLuint pixel, GLushort z) {
    unsigned char r = (pixel >> 24) & 0xFF;
    unsigned char g = (pixel >> 16) & 0xFF;
    unsigned char b = (pixel >> 8) & 0xFF;
    unsigned char a = pixel & 0xFF;
    return (255 - r) << 24 | (255 - g) << 16 | (255 - b) << 8 | a;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // ... [Initialization code]

    // Set the post-processing function
    glPostProcess(invertColors);

    // ... [Rendering loop]
}
```

## üìà Performance Optimization Tips

- **Enable OpenMP:**  
  Ensure that the `-fopenmp` flag is used during compilation to activate multithreading features.

- **SIMD Optimizations:**  
  Enable `alignas` in `zfeatures.h` to allow TinyGL to utilize SIMD instructions, boosting vertex processing speed.

- **Minimize State Changes:**  
  Reduce the number of OpenGL state changes (e.g., binding buffers, setting colors) within the rendering loop to enhance performance.

- **Batch Rendering Calls:**  
  Group similar rendering operations together to take full advantage of TinyGL's optimized rasterizer and avoid redundant computations.
